		<p>The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content. You can use it for blogs or news posts.</p>

			<summary>The Detail Tag</summary> <!--The summary tag is the header for the details tag.-->
			<p> The detail tag is used to provide more information on a certain topic. It is almost like a drop down,
			when you click on it it shows further information, and if you click on it again it will close that information.</p>

				<h2>The Time Tag and Datetime Attribute</h2>
				<p>The time tag defines a specific time. The datetime attribute is used to translate time into a machine readable time, which leads the browser to offer date reminders for the user. </p>
				<p>Here is an example: It is <time>3:30pm</time> right now. It is also <time datetime="2022-02-14 15:30"> Valentine's day</time></p>
