# HTML CSS Projects

This repository will be used for my HTML and CSS course projects.
In this repository you will find three major projects like our space station website,
which was renamed to 'The Boxing Academy' by me. You will also find our Movie Theater
website which was created with bootstrap. The last major project you will find is our 
portfolio website, where we  list out github and even have a functioning contact box. 

The Boxing academy website challenged me to think about how to build websites. We had 
to have a navigation bar, a gallery and a contact page. It was good to see how a basic
website is built and how css can make a website come to life.

The Movie theater website was built using bootstrap, an open-source framework that
can be used to build amazing websites. The website is basic, it was only meant to 
show us the basics with bootstrap. All of the code used was directly from the 
bootstrap documentation. 

Our Portfolio website challenged us to make our own website using all the knowledge
gained throughout this course. During this project there were times where I was forced
to think in the way that code would be executed which made me learn new things and helped
me establish a better understanding of how HTML and CSS work. 

Other things that you will find are just HTMl and CSS assignments and challenges 
that were assigned to us throughout the course.
