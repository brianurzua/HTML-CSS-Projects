		<blockquote cite = "https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Breathing_Styles">	All known Breathing Style currently taught within the Demon Slayer Corps is derived from Sun Breathing, the first one ever created. The majority of known Breathing Styles mimic a certain element of nature (i.e. flame, water and wind) and replicates it with the user's movements, techniques and abilities. </blockquote>
